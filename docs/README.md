# Testing Scientific Code

A method for testing code that has equations.\ 
by Drew Dolgert

This is a set of methods for testing scientific software.
It takes advantage of common structure of computation,
and common structure of risk, in scientific code in order
to make more detailed recommendations for how to organize
code to make it easier to test. There are also reminders
of various approaches specific to more mathematical
algorithms.
