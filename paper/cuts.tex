I have written unit tests without thinking about how I chose
what to test. Foremost in my mind is risk, which I estimate
from how likely something is to go wrong, how bad it will be,
and how hard it is to mitigate. That's the first two steps
of choosing unit tests.



Methods to test parameter logic all have the same underpinning,
that they will try to test at least one set of parameters from
each of the equivalence classes of inputs. Deciding what is an
equivalence class can be difficult. Sometimes two parameters
sets are equivalent in terms of the mathematical statement of 
the model, but their representation in code makes one set
have a different risk from another. For instance, a function of small
values would be well-defined as an equation, but it could cause
denormalization when written in code.
It can also be the other way around, that
the mathematical statement of a model makes clear what parameter
sets may be equivalent. Information from both statements of
a function will be helpful.

Not every parallel implementation is a brute-force retelling
of a model. Most mathematical functions provide finger-holds
support of their correctness.

The simplest of these are parameters for which a function
takes a known value. The function could be a mess of
polynomials of trigonometric quantities,
\begin{equation}
  y = (\sin x)^3 - 6 (\cos x)^2 + 2,
\end{equation}
but these simplify considerably at $x=0, \pi/4, \pi/2, \pi,$
and so on. If the function should divide by zero for some
number, then that, too, is a parameter for which the function
has a known value, an exception.


Our attention shifts to asking, which parameter sets should I test
for this function? Which parameter sets are meaningfully different
test? How do I know when I've tested enough of them?


\section{disaggregating function}

We could be testing a function where we know what answer it should
give. For instance, take a function which disaggregates its input
vector into finer bins.
\begin{lstlisting}
function disaggregate(coarse, coarse_bins, fine_bins)
\end{lstlisting}
For the unit test, we can create a smooth-enough function on
the fine bins, aggregate it to the coarse bins, and use
that as our known input.


\section{Faults in Mathematical Code}\label{sec:faults-and-failures}

For each section, ask what faults does this technique limit?
For instance, using a limit test for constant-mortality mean age
ensures you don't have a numerical fault.

\subsection{Fault versus Failure}
Jorgensen's \emph{Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach} distinguishes
faults from failures~\citep{jorgensen2013}.
A fault is the characters that were typed
incorrectly. A failure is observation that something went wrong.
For instance, there may be a fault that 0.3 is assigned to an integer
instead of assigning it to a double. The failure will happen later,
in the code that divides $1 / 0$.

Any failure is a problem. We don't want to throw exceptions or segfault.
Worse for mathematical code is when an error in the code isn't visible
but does give a wrong answer.
The worst problem is faults that aren't failures.


\subsection{Classes of Faults}
Jorgensen gives a set of fault categories and examples, elided here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input/Output - incorrect input accepted, incomplete result
    \item Logic - missing cases, test of wrong variable
    \item Computation - incorrect algorithm, parenthesis error
    \item Interface - parameter mismatch, call to wrong procedure
    \item Data - Incorrect type, wrong data, off by one
\end{itemize}
These all apply and, yes, read Jorgensen, but most of this article 
expands upon a single category of fault: incorrect algorithm.

This document covers two different kinds of failure-free faults.
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple data manipulation that doesn't do what the user
   expected it to do.
   
\item Mathematical functions that return a result that looks
   reasonable but isn't correct.
\end{itemize}
While these faults are within the taxonomy of faults
in any book on testing, we can discuss some of the particular
challenges that complicated mathematical functions introduce.
