From the IEEE 2010, what are your goals with classification? Our goal is minimizing risk.

This is the Orthogonal Defect Classification, which is more used than the IEEE standard. chillarege1996orthogonal.

Risk = chance of happening x how bad it is. From the IEEE doc.

"deviations to intent, which warrant change" (ODC)

Raleigh model of defect discovery. Simple and intuitive.

ODC defect type: assignment, checking, function, interface, timing.

Function - a function defect is one that affects significant capability, end-user features, product application programming interface (API), interface with hardware architecture, or global structure(s). It would require a formal design change.

Assignment. Converseley, an assignment defect indicates a few lines of code, such as the initialization of control blocks or data structure.

Interface. Corresponds to errors in interacting with other components, modules, device drivers via macros, call statements, control blocks, or parameter lists.

Checking. Addresses program logic that has failed to properly validate data and values before they are used, loop conditions, etc.

Timing / serialization. Timing/serialization errors are those that are corrected by improved management of shared and real-time resources.

Build/package/merge. These terms describe errors that occur due to mistakes in library systems, management of changes, or version control.

Documentation. Errors can affect both publications and maintenance notes.

Algorithm. Errors include efficiency or correctness problems that affect the task and can be fixed by (re)implementing an algorithm or local data structure without need for requesting a design change.
